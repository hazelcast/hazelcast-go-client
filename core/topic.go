package core

// Hazelcast provides distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers, which
// is also known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Publish and subscriptions are cluster-wide. When a
// member subscribes for a topic, it is actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster,
// including the new members joined after you added the listener.
//
// Messages are ordered, meaning that listeners(subscribers) will process the messages in the order they are actually
// published.
type ITopic interface {

	// IDistributedObject is the base interface for all distributed objects.
	IDistributedObject

	// AddMessageListener subscribes to this topic. When someone publishes a message on this topic.
	// OnMessage() function of the given messageListener is called. More than one message listener can be
	// added on one instance.
	// AddMessageListener returns registrationID of the listener.
	AddMessageListener(messageListener TopicMessageListener) (registrationID *string, err error)

	// RemoveMessageListener stops receiving messages for the listener with the given registrationID.
	// If the listener is already removed, this method does nothing.
	// RemoveMessageListener returns true if the listener with the given registrationID is removed.
	RemoveMessageListener(registrationID *string) (removed bool, err error)

	// Publish publishes the message to all subscribers of this topic.
	Publish(message interface{}) (err error)
