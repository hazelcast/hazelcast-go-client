Package hazelcast provides the Hazelcast Go client.

Hazelcast is an open-source distributed in-memory data store and computation platform. It provides a wide variety of distributed data structures and concurrency primitives.

Hazelcast Go client is a way to communicate to Hazelcast IMDG clusters and access the cluster data.

Configuration

If you are using Hazelcast and Go Client on the same computer, generally the default configuration should be fine.
This is great for trying out the client.
However, if you run the client on a different computer than any of the cluster members, you may need to do some simple configurations such as specifying the member addresses.

The Hazelcast IMDG members and clients have their own configuration options.
You may need to reflect some of the member side configurations on the client side to properly connect to the cluster.

In order to configure the client, you only need to create a new `hazelcast.Config{}`, which you can pass to `hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConnfig` function:

	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	client, err := hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig(context.TODO(), config)

Calling hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig with the default configuration is equivalent to hazelcast.StartNewClient.
The default configuration assumes Hazelcast is running at localhost:5701 with the cluster name set to dev.
If you run Hazelcast members in a different server than the client, you need to make certain changes to client settings.

Assuming Hazelcast members are running at hz1.server.com:5701, hz2.server.com:5701 and hz3.server.com:5701 with cluster name production, you would use the configuration below.
Note that addresses must include port numbers:

	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	config.Cluster.Name = "production"
	config.Cluster.Network.SetAddresses("hz1.server.com:5701", "hz2.server.com:5701", "hz3.server.com:5701")

You can also load configuration from JSON:

	text := `
		{
			"Cluster": {
				"Name": "production",
				"Network": {
					"Addresses": [
						"hz1.server.com:5701",
						"hz2.server.com:5701",
						"hz3.server.com:5701"
					]
				}
			}
		}`
	var config hazelcast.Config
	if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(text), &config); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

If you are changing several options in a configuration section, you may have to repeatedly specify the configuration section:

	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	config.Cluster.Name = "dev"
	config.Cluster.HeartbeatInterval = types.Duration(60 * time.Second)
	config.Cluster.Unisocket = true
	config.Cluster.SetLoadBalancer(cluster.NewRandomLoadBalancer())

You can simplify the code above by getting a reference to config.Cluster and update it:

	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	cc := &config.Cluster  // Note that we are getting a reference to config.Cluster!
	cc.Name = "dev"
	cc.HeartbeatInterval = types.Duration(60 * time.Second)
	cc.Unisocket = true
	cc.SetLoadBalancer(cluster.NewRandomLoadBalancer())

Note that you should get a reference to the configuration section you are updating, otherwise you would update a copy of it, which doesn't modify the configuration.

There are a few options that require a duration, such as config.Cluster.HeartbeatInterval, config.Cluster.Network.ConnectionTimeout and others.
You must use types.Duration instead of time.Duration with those options, since types.Duration values support human readable durations when deserialized from text:

	import "github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client/types"
	// ...
	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	config.Cluster.InvocationTimeout = types.Duration(3 * time.Minute)
	config.Cluster.Network.ConnectionTimeout = types.Duration(10 * time.Second)

That corresponds to the following JSON configuration. Refer to https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration for the available duration strings:

	{
		"Cluster": {
			"InvocationTimeout": "3m",
			"Network": {
				"ConnectionTimeout": "10s"
			}
	}

Here are all configuration items with their default values:

	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	config.ClientName = ""
	config.SetLabels()

	cc := &config.Cluster
	cc.Name = "dev"
	cc.HeartbeatTimeout = types.Duration(5 * time.Second)
	cc.HeartbeatInterval = types.Duration(60 * time.Second)
	cc.InvocationTimeout = types.Duration(120 * time.Second)
	cc.RedoOperation = false
	cc.Unisocket = false
	cc.SetLoadBalancer(cluster.NewRoundRobinLoadBalancer())

	cc.Network.SetAddresses("127.0.0.1:5701")
	cc.Network.SSL.Enabled = true
	cc.Network.SSL.SetTLSConfig(&tls.Config{})
	cc.Network.ConnectionTimeout = types.Duration(5 * time.Second)

	cc.Security.Credentials.Username = ""
	cc.Security.Credentials.Password = ""

	cc.Discovery.UsePublicIP = false

	cc.Cloud.Enabled = false
	cc.Cloud.Token = ""

	cc.ConnectionStrategy.ReconnectMode = cluster.ReconnectModeOn
	cc.ConnectionStrategy.Timeout = types.Duration(1<<63 - 1)
	cc.ConnectionStrategy.Retry.InitialBackoff = types.Duration(1*time.Second)
	cc.ConnectionStrategy.Retry.MaxBackoff = types.Duration(30*time.Second)
	cc.ConnectionStrategy.Retry.Multiplier = 1.05
	cc.ConnectionStrategy.Retry.Jitter = 0.0

	config.Serialization.PortableVersion = 0
	config.Serialization.LittleEndian = false
	config.Serialization.SetPortableFactories()
	config.Serialization.SetIdentifiedDataSerializableFactories()
	config.Serialization.SetCustomSerializer()
	config.Serialization.SetClassDefinitions()
	config.Serialization.SetGlobalSerializer() // Gob serializer

	config.Stats.Enabled = false
	config.Stats.Period = types.Duration(5 * time.Second)

	config.Logger.Level = logger.InfoLevel

Listening for Distributed Object Events

You can listen to creation and destroy events for distributed objects by attaching a listener to the client.
A distributed object is created when first referenced unless it already exists.
Here is an example:

	// Error handling is omitted for brevity.
	handler := func(e hazelcast.DistributedObjectNotified) {
		isMapEvent := e.ServiceName == hazelcast.ServiceNameMap
		isCreationEvent := e.EventType == hazelcast.DistributedObjectCreated
		log.Println(e.EventType, e.ServiceName, e.ObjectName, "creation?", isCreationEvent, "isMap?", isMapEvent)
	}
	subscriptionID, _ := client.AddDistributedObjectListener(ctx, handler)
	myMap, _ := client.GetMap(ctx, "my-map")
	// handler is called with: ServiceName=ServiceNameMap; ObjectName="my-map"; EventType=DistributedObjectCreated
	myMap.Destroy(ctx)
	// handler is called with: ServiceName=ServiceNameMap; ObjectName="my-map"; EventType=DistributedObjectDestroyed

If you don't want to receive any distributed object events, use client.RemoveDistributedObjectListener:

	client.RemoveDistributedObjectListener(subscriptionID)

Management Center Integration

Hazelcast Management Center can monitor your clients if client-side statistics are enabled.

You can enable statistics by setting config.Stats.Enabled to true.
Optionally, the period of statistics collection can be set using config.Stats.Period setting.
The labels set in configuration appear in the Management Center console:

	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	config.SetLabels("fast-cache", "staging")
	config.Stats.Enabled = true
	config.Stats.Period = 1 * time.Second
	client, err := hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig(config)
