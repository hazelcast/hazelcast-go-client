Package hazelcast provides the Hazelcast Go client.

Hazelcast Cloud Discovery

Hazelcast Go client can discover and connect to Hazelcast clusters running on Hazelcast Cloud https://cloud.hazelcast.com.
In order to activate it, set the cluster name, enable Hazelcast Cloud discovery and add Hazelcast Cloud Token to the configuration.
Here is an example:

	config := hazelcast.NewConfig()
	config.ClusterConfig.Name = "MY-CLUSTER-NAME"
	cc := &config.ClusterConfig.HazelcastCloudConfig
	cc.Enabled = true
	cc.Token = "MY-CLUSTER-TOKEN"
	client, err := hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig(config)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

Also check the code sample in https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client/tree/master/examples/discovery/cloud.

If you have enabled encryption for your cluster, you should also enable TLS/SSL configuration for the client.
