// FlakeIDGenerator is a cluster-wide unique ID generator. Generated IDs are 'int64' primitive values
// and are k-ordered (roughly ordered). IDs are in the range from `0` to `math.MaxInt64`.
//
// The IDs contain timestamp component and a node ID component, which is assigned when the member
// joins the cluster. This allows the IDs to be ordered and unique without any coordination between
// members, which makes the generator safe even in split-brain scenario.
//
// Timestamp component is in milliseconds since 1.1.2018, 0:00 UTC and has 41 bits. This caps
// the useful lifespan of the generator to little less than 70 years (until ~2088). The sequence component
// is 6 bits. If more than 64 IDs are requested in single millisecond, IDs will gracefully overflow to the next
// millisecond and uniqueness is guaranteed in this case. The implementation does not allow overflowing
// by more than 15 seconds, if IDs are requested at higher rate, the call will block. Note, however, that
// clients are able to generate even faster because each call goes to a different (random) member and
// the 64 IDs/ms limit is for single member.
//
// Note: Node ID overflow
// It is possible to generate IDs on any member or client as long as there is at least one
// member with join version smaller than 2^16 in the cluster. The remedy is to restart the cluster:
// nodeId will be assigned from zero again. Uniqueness after the restart will be preserved thanks to
// the timestamp component.
//
// FlakeIDGenerator requires Hazelcast 3.10.
