// PNCounter is PN (Positive-Negative) CRDT counter.
//
// The counter supports adding and subtracting values as well as
// retrieving the current counter value.
// The counter guarantees that whenever two nodes have received the
// same set of updates, possibly in a different order, their state is
// identical, and any conflicting updates are merged automatically.
// If no new updates are made to the shared state, all nodes that can
// communicate will eventually have the same data.
//
// The invocation is remote. This may lead to indeterminate state,
// the update may be applied but the response has not been received.
// In this case, the caller will be notified with a HazelcastTargetDisconnectedError.
//
// The read and write methods provide monotonic read and RYW (read-your-write)
// guarantees. These guarantees are session guarantees which means that if
// no replica with the previously observed state is reachable, the session
// guarantees are lost and the method invocation will return a
// HazelcastConsistencyLostError. This does not mean
// that an update is lost. All of the updates are part of some replica and
// will be eventually reflected in the state of all other replicas. This
// error just means that you cannot observe your own writes because
// all replicas that contain your updates are currently unreachable.
// After you have received a HazelcastConsistencyLostError, you can either
// wait for a sufficiently up-to-date replica to become reachable in which
// case the session can be continued or you can reset the session by calling
// the Reset() method. If you have called the Reset() method,
// a new session is started with the next invocation to a CRDT replica.
//
// NOTE:
// The CRDT state is kept entirely on non-lite (data) members. If there
// aren't any and the methods here are invoked, they will
// fail with a HazelcastNoDataMemberInClusterError.
//
// PNCounter requires Hazelcast 3.10.
