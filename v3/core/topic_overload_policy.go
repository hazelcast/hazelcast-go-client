// TopicOverloadPolicy is a policy to deal with an overloaded topic; so topic where there is no place to store new messages.
//
// This policy can only be used in combination with the ReliableTopic.
//
// The reliable topic uses a Ringbuffer to store the messages. A ringbuffer doesn't track where
// readers are, so therefore it has no concept of a slow consumers. This provides many advantages like high performance reads, but
// it also gives the ability to the reader to reread the same message multiple times in case of error.
//
// Because a ringbuffer has a capacity and to prevent that a fast producer overwrites the messages needed by a slow consumer, a
// time to live time can be set on the ringbuffer in server configuration.
// This policy controls how the publisher is going to deal with the situation that a ringbuffer is full
//  and the oldest item in the ringbuffer is not old enough to get overwritten.
//
// So keep in mind that this retention period keeps the messages in memory, even though it might be that all readers already
// have completed reading.
